# multisigwallet
I would like to make sure that those that I used to help make this code are properly credited. 
This was made with assistance from [Crypto Market Pool](https://cryptomarketpool.com/create-a-multi-signature-multi-sig-wallet-solidity-smart-contract/).  Please make sure to give them the due credit they deserve for this. 
I also used [Smart Contract Programmer - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh7r6Ze-0Bs) as a guide to help design this.  Please check out his videos.
